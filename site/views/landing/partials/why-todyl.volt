	A strong cyber defense consists of multiple layers of protection (we call this defense-in-depth). Historically, only large companies could afford the expensive hardware and industry experts associated with this type of protection. Todyl has moved the capabilities of expensive security hardware into the cloud, giving small businesses access to the protection they need, at a cost they can afford.
